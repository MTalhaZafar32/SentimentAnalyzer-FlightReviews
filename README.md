# Airline Review Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a Python mini project that focuses on scraping airline reviews and performing sentiment analysis on the collected data. The project is designed to help analyze customer sentiments and opinions towards various airlines.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to collect airline reviews from different sources and analyze the sentiments expressed in those reviews. The project consists of the following components:

1. **Web Scraping**: We utilize web scraping techniques to gather airline reviews from popular review websites or forums. The scraping process involves extracting relevant information such as the review text, rating, date, and other metadata.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Once the reviews are collected, we perform data preprocessing to clean and prepare the text data for sentiment analysis. This step involves tasks such as removing noise, handling special characters, and standardizing the text format.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**: The sentiment analysis component is yet to be implemented. This step will involve employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify the reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The sentiment analysis model will help us gain insights into customer opinions and identify overall satisfaction levels.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
AirlineReviewSentimentAnalysis/
  ├── data/
  │   ├── airline_reviews.csv
  │   
  ├── src/
  │   ├── web_scraper.py
  │   ├── data_preprocessing.py
  │   └── sentiment_analysis.py
  ├── notebooks/

  ├── README.md
  └── .gitignore
```

- The `data/` directory will store the collected airline reviews in a CSV format. Currently, it contains a placeholder file (`airline_reviews.csv`) that will be populated during the scraping process.

- The `src/` directory contains the Python source code for different project components. `web_scraper.py` is responsible for scraping airline reviews, `data_preprocessing.py` handles the text data cleaning tasks, and `sentiment_analysis.py` will implement the sentiment analysis algorithm.

- The `notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, data preprocessing, and other analysis tasks. These notebooks provide an interactive environment to experiment and develop the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Tayyab-R/SentimentAnalyzer-FlightReviews.git`

2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Execute the web scraping script: `python src/web_scraper.py`

4. Perform data preprocessing tasks: `python src/data_preprocessing.py` (work in progress)

5. Implement the sentiment analysis component (work in progress).

Feel free to explore the project files and customize them according to your requirements. Contributions and enhancements to the project are always welcome.
